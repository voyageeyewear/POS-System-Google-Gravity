## Adding the Voyage Eyewear Logo

To add the company logo to invoices:

1. Save your logo image as `voyage-logo.png` in this directory
2. Recommended dimensions: 200x200 pixels or similar square/portrait ratio
3. Supported formats: PNG (with transparency recommended)
4. The logo will appear at the top left of the invoice, before "SS ENTERPRISES" text

## Current Logo File
- **Required filename**: `voyage-logo.png`
- **Location**: `/backend/assets/voyage-logo.png`

## Notes
- The invoice will work without the logo (it will just skip it)
- Logo size on invoice: 60x60 pixels (auto-scaled)
- Logo position: Top left corner, margin 15px
